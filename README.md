# The Fibonacci Challenge🔢
My next challenge was creating a code that would return a sequence of numbers BUT with a pattern. I had to create a series that continued adding up the last two numbers and then pushing them to the list until
there were as many numbers as the user chose.

# This was veryh challenging💭...
This is one of the most challenging exercises I've had to do. I had the concept and I understood what to do but I couldn't convert it to code. After a lot of trial and error I manage to create the program my way.

# What I learnt✨
I learnt a lot. A lot. There were concepts that I knew but never implemented and I had to for the first time in this challenge which expanded my knowledge of it. I learnt that you can't write the position index with
a negative number which made me have an headache cause how easy it would have been if it was possible!😩

#### Overall this was a very insightful challenge and I'm excited for what else I'll come across because I came out of this one with so much new knowledge☺️
